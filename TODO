Add tests.
Refactor remainng checks that have a similar implementation so that they build on shared methods rather than copying code.
Refactor so that checks can be written be extending a class, rather than all being in the grallect class.
Make it possible to scan a directory and load all the checks defined in it, rather than requiring them all to be in a single file.
Make it possible to load multiple config files from a directory, so each check can define its own config file.
